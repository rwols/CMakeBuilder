- Add Ninja generator for Windows.

  For Windows users: to enable Ninja, download a binary from

      github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases

  put it somewhere like C:\Ninja, and add that to your %PATH%.

- Refactor vcvarsall.bat handling for Windows.

- Improve Visual Studio output panel syntax highlighting

- Allow Visual Studio to compile for 64 bit (see below).

- New item in cmake dictionary: "env"

  This is a dict of key-value pairs of strings. Place your environment 
  variables at configure time in here. For example, to select clang as 
  your compiler if you have gcc set as default, you can use

      "env": { "CC": "clang", "CXX": "clang++" }

- New item in cmake dictionary: "target_architecture"

  This is only applicable for Windows users. "target_architecture" must be 
  a string and can be one of "x86", "amd64" or "arm".

- New item in cmake dictionary: "visual_studio_versions"

  This is only applicable for Windows users. "visual_studio_versions" must 
  be a list of numbers specifying the preferred versions of Visual Studio, 
  provided that "Visual Studio" is the chosen generator. The priority is 
  specified by the order that the numbers appear in the list. For example, 
  if the list is

      "visual_studio_versions": [ 15, 14 ]

  then CMakeBuilder will first attempt to configure the project for Visual
  Studio 15 2017, and if that's not found, then it will attempt to
  configure for  Visual Studio 14 2015. Moreover, if "target_architecture"
  is set, then it will append a further architecture argument to the cmake
  generator invocation. For instance, if "target_architecture" is set to
  "amd64" and "visual_studio_versions" is set to [ 15 ], the generator
  invocation will be "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64".
