- Improved the diagnosis output somewhat by using the "tabulate" library.
- Removed the migrator logic. I hope everybody migrated their cmake dicts
  to the settings dict.
- Improved "auto configure" somewhat.

It's finally here! The moment you've all been waiting for! Version 1.0!
All kidding aside, I consider the plugin in a mature state now, so let's
call this version 1.0.

What will the future hold for this plugin? Since cmake version 3.7, there
has been "server" functionality in the cmake executable. You can check if
your cmake has a server mode by running "cmake -E capabilities".

The server mode of cmake can configure the project, list all targets,
and report on various progress updates. This is basically what we've been
doing with this plugin "manually". The roadmap for version 2.0 of this
plugin will be to integrate this server functionality with Sublime Text
to give us a smoother cmake experience.
